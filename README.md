# 1. STRING 

This function uses the split method to convert the string into an array of characters, then it uses the map method to swap the case of each character. Finally, it uses the join method to convert the array back into a string.
# 2. PRIMENUMBERS

This function first defines a helper function isPrime that checks if a number is prime. Then it uses the filter method to create a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. The isPrime function is optimized to check for divisibility only up to the square root of the number, which makes it more efficient.
# 3. NUMBERGENERATOR


The function first initializes an empty array result. Then, it checks if the start value is less than the end value. If it is, the function enters a loop that starts from the start value and increments it by 1 until it reaches the end value. For each iteration, the current value is pushed into the result array.

If the start value is greater than the end value, the function enters a different loop that starts from the start value and decrements it by 1 until it reaches the end value. For each iteration, the current value is pushed into the result array.

Finally, if the start value is equal to the end value, the function simply pushes the start value into the result array.

Once the loop(s) are finished, the function returns the result array, which contains the numbers between the given start and end values.

This function is efficient because it only iterates through the necessary range of numbers and does not perform any unnecessary calculations. It also accurately identifies the range of numbers between the given start and end values and returns them in the same order they appear in the input parameters.
